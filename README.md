## Introduction

Our web service is designed to detect Radiogenomic Brain Tumor type RSNA-MICCAI on DICOM images of patients using AI. Radiogenomics is a field of medical research that combines imaging features with genomic data to identify genetic mutations in tumors. The RSNA-MICCAI dataset is a publicly available dataset that contains annotated brain tumor images, which can be used for training and testing machine learning algorithms.

## Features

Our web service offers the following features:

- AI-based detection of Radiogenomic Brain Tumor type RSNA-MICCAI on DICOM images
- Ability to upload DICOM images for analysis
- Fast and accurate results
- Secure and private data handling
- User-friendly interface

## How it Works

Our web service uses a deep learning algorithm to analyze DICOM images of brain tumors. The algorithm has been trained on the RSNA-MICCAI dataset, which contains annotated images of various types of brain tumors. When a user uploads a DICOM image, the algorithm analyzes the image and identifies the specific type of brain tumor present. The results are displayed to the user within seconds.

## Benefits

The benefits of our web service include:

- Early detection of brain tumors
- Accurate diagnosis of brain tumor type
- Fast and efficient analysis of DICOM images
- Reduced reliance on human expertise
- Improved patient outcomes

## Conclusion
